               <h1>What's Holistic Therapy?</h1> 
               <p>
                In a world where we are tired and taken over by the routine, often what we need is to stop for a moment, analyze our problems and reconnect with our essence.
               </p>
               <p>
                Based mainly on methods of relaxation, relief of trigger points, manipulation of energies and changes in lifestyle, Holistic Therapy does help us to observe and reflect on different aspects of our life.
               </p>
               <p>
                From this reflection, undoubtedly, positive solutions and results will emerge, promoting health and preventing diseases that compromise the integrity of our body-mind.
