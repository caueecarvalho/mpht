                    <p class="little">From an early age I realized that my mission would be to help people face their problems and traumas and, after years of study and dedication, I discovered an effective way to solve them: Holistic Therapy.</p>
                    <p class="little">I confess that I was initially quite skeptical, but the rapid and progressive improvement that I witnessed in myself and in the others around me stimulated to seek scientific proof and my technical improvement.</p>
                    <p class="little">Today, knowing deeply the power of alternative medicine, I invite you to join me on this journey of self-care, in search of your own truth and well-being.</p>

               <h1>What's Holistic Therapy?</h1> 
               <p>
                In a world where we are tired and taken over by daily routine, often what we need is to stop for a moment, analyze our problems and reconnect with our essence.
               </p>
               <p>
                Based mainly on methods of relaxation, energy control and changes in lifestyle, Holistic Therapy helps us to observe and reflect on different aspects of our lives.
               </p>
               <p>
                From this observation, surely, positive solutions and results will happen, promoting health and preventing diseases that compromise the integrity of our body-mind.
